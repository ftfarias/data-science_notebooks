    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking Machine Learning algorithms try to characterize a tradeoff between generalization (how well the model represents the general concept or function to learn) and apporoximation (how well the model fits the data). A small error denotes a good approximation of the function _out of sample_. A more complex model has a better chance of approximating $f$, in contrast a less complex model has a better chance of generalizing (picking the right approximation) out of sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal definition can be given after *Hastie, et al. 2009*.\n",
    "Let's explain Bias-Variance using linear regression problems, and specifically we'll use a squared-error measure as loss function. Assume further that the output $Y = f(X) + \\epsilon$ where $E(\\epsilon) = 0$ and $Var(\\epsilon) = \\sigma_\\epsilon^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate a model $\\widehat{f}(X)$ of a function $f(X)$, and the expected squared error of a given point $x_0$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Err(x_0) = E[(Y - \\widehat{f}(x_0))^2]$$\n",

Usually the more complex is the model the lower the Bias but the higher the variance. We can give a pictorial illustration of the relationship with the image below.

    "Suppose the center (red) of each diagram is the real function to learn. As we move away from the center the prediction gets worse and worse. Each dot in the picture is a realization of the model given a subsample of the dataset; each circle is a different model (whose particular realizations are the dots) and model's characteristics are described by the two corresponding labels (horizontal and vertical).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a model (top left) with both Low Bias and Low Variance is practically impossible since, as we will see next, if we decrese one the other increase (in this case both generalization and approximation will be good and we could learn almost the real function); the hard part is hence finding the best possible balance between the two. In case of Low Bias and High Variance (top right), the model is capable of representing the correct function but the model may be too complex, and thus more supsceptible in variation on the dataset. For this reason each dot (function approximation) draw from this model may vary considerably from estimate to estimate, depending on the particular subsample used for training. For High Bias and Low Variance (bottom left) the model is constantly learning a substantially different function respect to the true one, but each run is independent from the particular subsample of data (it generalize well but it approximate poorly). If we have a model that has both High Varianche and High Bias (bottom right) the model si constantly learning a wrong model with high variability between subsamples and thus the probability of picking a good model is very low. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can think of Bias and Variance as urn that contains a bunch of candidate approximations of an unknown function $f$. If we have few candidates in the urn (think about degenerating and have only one function in it), but each candidate is far away from the true value of $f$; in this case the Bias is high and the Variance is low, no matter of the dataset we will always return the same function. If we have a bigger urn containing a lot of candidates the probability that it contains the true function is higher, but it is difficult to navigate through the candidates to find the right one. In this case the Bias is lower but the Variance is higher, we have so many varieties that depending on which sample we get the function differs.\n",

    "`Stochastic Gradient Descent` is a simple yet very efficient approach to discriminative learning of linear classifiers under convex loss functions such as (linear) Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression. Even though SGD has been around in the machine learning community for a long time, it has received a considerable amount of attention just recently in the context of large-scale learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGD has been successfully applied to large-scale and sparse machine learning problems often encountered in text classification and natural language processing. Given that the data is sparse, the classifiers in this module easily scale to problems with more than $10^5$ training examples and more than $10^5$ features."
